!!!DS and why?
Thy are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms.
They help to manage and organize data.
They make code cleaner and easier to understand.

ADT (list, queue, map, vehicle)

Complexity Analysis
how much time does this algorithm need to finish?
how much space does this algorithm need for its computation?
